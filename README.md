# Matrix Factorization for Recommender Systems with ApacheSpark
The folder contains three files:
- README.html (this one)
- requirements.txt (file with al the libraries installed in my machine)
- Recommender_System.ipynb (jupyter notebook program)

The program is the solution of Matrix Factorization algorithm using the movielens dataset  [_Movie Lens_](https://movielens.org/). It is written in Python and the manipulation of the dataset is made with PySpark.
